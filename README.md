The Admin Portal is a secure, web-based administrative console that provides a user-friendly interface for configuring, managing, and monitoring various components of the R-Switch payment platform. It serves as a centralized hub for administrators, enabling them to efficiently perform key tasks such as adapter setup, workflow and routing rule management, system configuration, deployment scheduling, and real-time system monitoring‚Äîall from a single point of access.

Through this intuitive portal, users can easily configure L1 (inbound) and L3 (outbound) adapters, define complex workflows and routing rules, schedule and deploy changes, and oversee the entire system‚Äôs performance. The Admin Portal also provides access to real-time transaction logs, system dashboards, and import/export tools, facilitating operational transparency, compliance, and faster troubleshooting.

Designed with ease of use and scalability in mind, the Admin Portal streamlines administrative operations, reduces configuration complexity, and empowers users with complete control over the R-Switch ecosystem‚Äîwithout the need for manual scripts or backend interventions.

Key Features:

Dashboard: Visualize transaction trends and system performance through interactive charts.

Monitoring: Track real-time health of adapters, engines, and security components.

Transaction Logs: Audit and filter past transactions for analysis and compliance.

Configuration Management: Set up BINs, tags, lookup values, and adapter parameters.

Import/Export & Backup: Backup, migrate, or restore settings across environments.
